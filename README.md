Project Developed for Practicing JavaScript:

In this project, I've created a feature that changes the appearance of a picture based on the time of day. The user experience varies depending on the time they're using the application.

1. **Morning (00:00 - 11:59 AM):** During this time frame, the picture takes on a morning appearance, with bright and clear colors dominating the scene. The background maintains its clarity, creating a fresh and vibrant atmosphere.

2. **Afternoon (12:00 PM - 05:59 PM):** As the day progresses, from noon until evening, the picture transitions into an afternoon theme. Warm and soothing colors become prominent, mirroring the ambiance of a calm afternoon. The background now emanates a pleasant heat.

3. **Night (06:00 PM - 11:59 PM):** As the sun sets, the picture transforms into a nighttime setting. Dark and rich colors dominate the scene, creating a cozy and atmospheric mood. The background adopts a darker tone, enhancing the feeling of being in a nighttime environment.

By incorporating these dynamic changes based on the time of day, the project aims to provide users with a more engaging and immersive experience while they practice their JavaScript skills. This feature not only showcases the versatility of JavaScript but also adds a touch of realism to the application, making it a more enjoyable and interactive tool.
